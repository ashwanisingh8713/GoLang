In my past working day I supposed to work on view_group table, but later realised it is not going to work,
So to feed the data in nested fields super-column is required.

So created structure for Super-Column with respective Fields and types.
I have Designed and Categorised Shopping Cart Database for E-Commerce.

	- Static Data
		- view_group
        - category
        - product
        - discount
        - user
        - manufacturer
    - Session Data
        - shopping_session
        - cart_item
        - wishlist
    - Processed Data
        - order_details
        - order_items
        - payment_details

Currently defining the fields. once it is done I will start work on making Tables at DB end.
Next, I will start work at server end coding for DB integration and DB's CRUD operation and making the data structure through the api request.
